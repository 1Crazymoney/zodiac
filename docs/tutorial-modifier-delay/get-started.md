## About the Zodiac Delay Modifier 

This modifier allows avatars (accounts) to enforce a time delay between when a module initiates a transaction and when it can be executed by an avatar.

[Read more here](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-delay). For a more technical guide on how to use the Delay Modifier beyond the Zodiac App interface, see the Github repo [Setup Guide](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-delay/blob/main/docs/setup_guide.md).

## Setup a Gnosis Safe

If you've already set up a Gnosis Safe you'd like to use for this tutorial, skip to the next step below.
