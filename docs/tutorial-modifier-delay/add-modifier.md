For this tutorial, we've chosen short time periods.

Once you've entered the `Cooldown` and `Expiration` parameters, click the `Add Module` button.

## Submit transaction

After that, you should see a Gnosis Safe modal prompting you to review the transaction. Click `Submit` when ready:

Confirm the transaction with your web3 wallet that is a signer on the Gnosis Safe.
