## Setup a Gnosis Safe

If you've already set up a Gnosis Safe you'd like to use for this tutorial, skip to the next step below.

If not, check out the Gnosis Safe Help Center. The [Create a Safe](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/3876461-create-a-safe) tutorial will walk you through the full process of creating a new Gnosis Safe account in just 60 seconds.

Note that for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be using a Gnosis Safe deployed on the Rinkeby testnetwork. You can create a Gnosis Safe on Rinkeby at [http://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io](http://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io/).

## Navigate to the Zodiac App

On your Gnosis Safe's left menu, click the `APPS` option. Here you'll find apps available through Gnosis Safe. Scroll to the end of this list, and you'll find the Zodiac App.
