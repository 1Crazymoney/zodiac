# Designate token

Next you should click on the Exit Module available through the Zodiac App on Gnosis Safe. When you open the Exit Module, it will look like this:

![Exit Module](/img/tutorial/exit_1.png)

The Exit Module prompts you to enter a `Token Contract Address` and a `Circulating Supply Amount`. The Token Contract Address and Circulting Supply Amount refer to the ERC20 token participants can redeem for a proportional share of this accountâ€™s compatible ERC20 digital assets.

If you need to find the Token Contract Address and Circulating Supply Amount, look up the token on a block explorer like [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) or token tracker with historical data like [https://coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). Be sure to verify these details are correct; we can help you in the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) if you have any questions. 

In this tutorial, we'll use the [XEENUS](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x022e292b44b5a146f2e8ee36ff44d3dd863c915c?a=0x9313f9b6a2255f46ca963780665e51afb80bd15a) token, a test token on the Rinkeby testnetwork. On Etherscan, you can see the token's contract address.
