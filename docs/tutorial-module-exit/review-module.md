After confirming the transaction, you should return to a window that displays your configured Exit Module's settings. From here you can read, write, or remove the module at any time:

`deniedTokens`: 

`designatedToken`: This is the contract address of the designated token.


`executor`: This is the contract address of the module executor, the avatar (account) that can execute related tasks.


`getCirculatingSupply`: This returns the token's circulating supply amount.


`initialized`: This returns a Boolean (true or false) regarding whether the module is initialized.


`owner`: This is the contract address of the module owner.

## Write contract

To update these Parameters, click the `Write Contract` tab.
